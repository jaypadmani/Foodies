Let's start the journey begin for our project. ðŸ‘‡

Online food ordering and delivery is the process in which order for the food is placed through the internet and delivered to the customer to the specified place. Due to the hectic schedule, we cannot cook food on time or get tired of visiting a restaurant and then eat.
